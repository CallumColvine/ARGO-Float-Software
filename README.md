# ARGO-Float-Software
Software designed for data analysis and representation from ARGO floats. This is a continuation of the work of Howard Freeland.

Time Series interpolates data from nearby floats at a specific point. Time Series has been reworked. It is under user evaluation and more extensive testing. Main development has stopped. 

The Circulation app is now under development.
