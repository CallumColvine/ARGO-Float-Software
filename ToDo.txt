ToDo for ARGO Time Series Software:
- Fix screen switches so user can see the “Loading” screen
	- To have real time updating progress bar, I think I have to 
	do multithreaded programming. This is too much time for now, 
	it will stay as is
- Test with actual use paths instead of fake testing paths
    - Allow user to edit save paths with browse window?
- Does TimeSeries work in non-Pacific ?

ToDo for ARGO Circulation Software:
- Contour plotting section
