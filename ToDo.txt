ToDo for ARGO Time Series Software:

- Wait for feedback from Tetjana before proceeding on these.
	- Fix screen switches so user can see the “Loading” screen
		- To have real time updating progress bar, I think I have to 
		domultithreaded programming. This is too much time for now, 
		it will stay as is
	- Test with actual use paths instead of fake testing paths
	    - Allow user to edit save paths with browse window?
